    In a blockchain system, many nodes spread transactions and blocks simultaneously. Therefore, the behaviors of nodes and the mining processes are complex and difficult to identify. In this paper, we present a visualization tool which identifies the mining strategies of miners and the delays of networks in a blockchain system which employs proof-of-work as the consensus protocol. Our approach is based on the simulation of a blockchain system, which is built on a platform of the multi-agent system. The data sent between the nodes are monitored and recorded by the watchdog, and then they are sent to the visualizer. As a result, the visualizer can provide a fantastic visualization of internal blockchain processes in real-time. The visualization tool can help researchers to analyze the mining processes clearly and correctly. \\
