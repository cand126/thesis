    First, I would like to appreciate the useful guides and suggestions from the supervisor, Prof. Dr. Thomas Rose, and the advisor, Thomas Osterland. Additionally, Prof. Wolfgang Prinz also helped me to improve the weakness of this thesis. Last but not the least, I owe the success of this thesis to my parents, Li-Ju Chen and Yuan-Chun Ma, and my wife, Yu-Ming Chien. They supported me through the difficulties that I encountered during the work.
